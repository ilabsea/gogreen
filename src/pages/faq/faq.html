    <h4>WHAT IS THIS GOGREEN APP</h4>
    <p>
      GOGREEN app is a free tool to engage people into making Cambodia a cleaner
      and greener place. Everyone can contribute by marking places which are clean
      by dropping a happy green pin, or marking areas where waste hasn't been
      cleaner up with an angry red pin. You also have the option to drop a pin in
      areas where trash bins are necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      GOGREEN app gathers your feedback in order to engage communities, organisations
      and institutions to join efforts in a more effective waste management system.
      Together, we can be the change.
