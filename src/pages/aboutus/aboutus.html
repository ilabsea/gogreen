      GOGREEN app is a free tool to engage people into making Cambodia
      a cleaner and greener place. Everyone can contribute by marking places
      which are clean by dropping a happy green pin, or marking areas
      where waste hasnâ€™t been cleaner up with an angry red pin.
      You also have the option to drop a pin in areas where trash bins are necessary.

    <p>
      GOGREEN app gathers your feedback in order to engage communities,
      organisations and institutions to join efforts in a more effective
      waste management system. Together, we can be the change.

    <p>
      GOGREEN app is created by GOGREEN Cambodia, a volounteering organization
      and inSTEDD iLabSEA.
